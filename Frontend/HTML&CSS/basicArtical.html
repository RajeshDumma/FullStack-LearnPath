    <h1>My First into Web Development</h1>
    <p>Today i started learning the basic of HTML. I explored how to use heading tags to organize content on a web page </p>
    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <p>HTML provides different heading levels from <strong>h1</strong> to <strong>h6</strong>. Each heading defines the structure and improtanceof text on the page. <br> 
    I also learned how to write paragraph using the <strong>p</strong> tag and how to use <strong>br</strong> to break lines inside a paragraph.</p>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>Even though these are simple tags, they help in making web pages clear, readable, and accessible.<br>
  This is just the beginning of my full stack development journey!</p>

  <h3>Next Step</h3>
  <p>Tomorrow I will explore lists and image tags.</p>
